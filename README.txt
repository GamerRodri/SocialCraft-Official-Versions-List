Now, find the 1.16.5 installation, and run it.

Once it is finished loading and shows the main menu, close Minecraft,

Now, download the latest 1.16.5 forge version here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html.

Run the downloaded file as you would with an .exe file.
Now, set the installation type to "Install Client", and click "OK".

Wait for the installation to complete (it will show a message once done), then navigate to %APPDATA%\.minecraft in File Explorer.

Copy all the mods files from the downloaded zip file into the mods folder.

Restart the minecraft launcher, and navigate to the installations tab.

There should be a new installation named "Forge".

Run the installation, and you are done!
